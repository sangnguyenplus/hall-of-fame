# Root Cause

The issue was caused by:

- **Incorrect Theme Method**: Using `Theme::scope()` instead of `Theme::of()`
- **Complex View Structure**: Using `@extends` layouts in views that were meant
  to be simple template fragments

## Solution Applied

âœ… **Changed Theme Method**: Replaced `Theme::scope()` with `Theme::of()` in all
certificate controller methods

âœ… **Simplified View Structure**: Converted vendor override views from `@extends`
layout pattern to simple HTML fragments that get embedded in the theme

âœ… **Fixed Missing render() calls**: Ensured all Theme methods have `->render()`
calls

## Routes Now Working âœ…

âœ… [Hall of Fame Certificates](https://whozidis.com/hall-of-fame/certificates)
(200 OK) - Displays certificate listing

âœ… [Certificate Verification](https://whozidis.com/hall-of-fame/certificates/verify/{id})
(200 OK) - Certificate verification page

âœ… [Certificate Details](https://whozidis.com/hall-of-fame/certificates/{id})
(200 OK) - Certificate details page

The TypeError has been eliminated and all certificate functionality is now
operational! ðŸŽ‰
