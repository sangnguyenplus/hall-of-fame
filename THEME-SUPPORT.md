# Hall of Fame Plugin - Theme Support

## Automatic Theme Compatibility

The Hall of Fame plugin is designed to work with **any theme** automatically.
It uses a smart fallback system:

### How It Works

1. **Universal Views**: All views work with any theme using `Theme::of()` method
2. **Theme Detection**: Automatically detects your current theme  
3. **Fallback System**: Uses universal views that work with all themes
4. **Optional Customization**: You can create theme-specific views if needed

### Supported Themes

The plugin works with:

- ✅ **Any theme** (universal compatibility)
- ✅ Default theme
- ✅ Martfury theme (optimized)
- ✅ Whozidis theme (optimized)
- ✅ Custom themes
- ✅ All commercial themes

### Theme-Specific Customization (Optional)

If you want to customize views for your specific theme:

#### Option 1: Theme Override (Recommended)

Create custom views in your theme directory:

```php
themes/your-theme/views/plugins/hall-of-fame/
├── certificates.blade.php
├── certificate-verify.blade.php  
├── certificate-details.blade.php
└── hall-of-fame.blade.php
```

#### Option 2: Auto-Generate Theme Structure

Run the setup command to auto-generate theme-specific views:

```bash
php artisan hall-of-fame:setup-theme your-theme-name
```

#### Option 3: Manual Plugin Customization

Copy and modify views in the plugin's theme directory:

```php
platform/plugins/hall-of-fame/resources/views/themes/your-theme/
```

### View Priority Order

Laravel resolves views in this priority order:

1. **Theme override**: `themes/your-theme/views/plugins/hall-of-fame/`
2. **Plugin theme-specific**: `platform/plugins/hall-of-fame/resources/views/themes/your-theme/`
3. **Plugin default**: `platform/plugins/hall-of-fame/resources/views/themes/default/`
4. **Plugin universal**: `platform/plugins/hall-of-fame/resources/views/public/`

### No Configuration Required

The plugin works out-of-the-box with any theme. No manual setup or vendor
overrides needed.

### For Plugin Developers

When distributing this plugin:

- ✅ Works with any Botble CMS installation
- ✅ No theme dependencies
- ✅ No vendor overrides required
- ✅ Users can optionally customize for their theme
- ✅ Safe for public distribution

### Migration from Vendor Overrides

If you were using vendor overrides before:

1. The plugin now works without them
2. You can safely remove `/resources/views/vendor/plugins/hall-of-fame/`
3. Functionality remains the same
4. Better compatibility with all themes
